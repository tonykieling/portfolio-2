Do I need bootstrap being load at index.html?
 A: the CSS one yes - Header is using it
  but, removed it from package.json
generate new build and test it.

- commented out components not being used (which were calling unused images)
- commented out bootstrap on index.html
- removed from package.json
    "bootstrap": "^5.1.0",
- FE npm i - and npm audit fix--force
  still has left with 6 high severity (better than 6 critical)
- BE was updated well
- email message ("reply to" instead of "reply for")
- sitemap, removed

- had to
  npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object
  bkz when running npm run build, received
One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.
