    web developer
    professional summary
      In my professional history I have been doing different jobs, most of them related to IT but I also worked in out of this field. I used to be a IT instructor and a college IT security teacher. I also worked as general services, such as inventory maintenance, warehouse positions and truck driver. But most of my laborer years, I have been working with IT, also in differnet areas, such as customer service, infraestucture, processes and managment and latelly I have been dedicated my efforts in software development. All my proessional experiences allowed me to see and feel (experience) how is like to be in other position and I am sure that all of that give me more maturity and flexibility to face life's challenges in general.

      Besides being a web developer, I hold a professional history that involves other IT areas.
