node -v   = v.16.7
npm -v    = 7.20.3

after receiving error when creating the project and executing "npx create-react-app app", I updated nvm, node, npm but nothing. 
So, I followed a slackoverflow and installed locally create-react-app and runned again npx. It worked. After creating the project, it is possible remove after running npx create-react-app.
