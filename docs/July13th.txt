*** Planning to move to Next.js later and have some sontent as SSR.

Do I need bootstrap being load at index.html?
 A: the CSS one yes - Header is using it
  but, removed it from package.json
generate new build and test it.

- commented out components not being used (which were calling unused images)
- commented out bootstrap on index.html
- tkwebdev as h1
- removed from package.json
    "bootstrap": "^5.1.0",
- FE npm i - and npm audit fix--force
  still has left with 6 high severity (better than 6 critical)
- reomved the shortcut to bcit-alumni (I did this before, but for some reason was there yet)
- same ^^ for UP&Running istead of Porfolio
